# 📊 UK Employment Data (Tableau)

This project analyzes employment changes in the United Kingdom using EMSI job change data and a Tableau dashboard.  
The Excel dataset contains employment levels for 2011 and 2014 across UK cities and industries (1-digit and 2-digit SIC codes).  
The Tableau workbook visualizes job growth, job decline, and percentage changes across sectors and regions through interactive charts.

This project demonstrates core skills in data preparation, Tableau dashboard design, and labour market trend analysis using real UK employment data.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

This project uses the **EMSI Job Change UK** dataset, which contains employment statistics for UK cities and industries.  
The dataset includes employment counts for **2011** and **2014**, along with absolute and percentage job change over that period.

### **Main Fields in the Dataset**

#### 🏙️ Location Information
- **City** – UK city where the employment values are recorded  

#### 🏭 Industry Classification
The dataset provides two levels of industry detail:
- **1 digit SIC** – Broad industry categories  
- **2 digit SIC** – More detailed industry sub-sectors  

#### 👥 Employment Metrics
- **2011 Jobs** – Employment count in 2011  
- **2014 Jobs** – Employment count in 2014  
- **Change** – Difference in employment (2014 minus 2011)  
- **% Change** – Percentage change over time  

### **Dataset Structure**
The workbook contains two sheets:
- **1 digit** – High-level industry categories  
- **2 digit** – Detailed industry breakdowns  

These sheets were used to build the Tableau visualizations analyzing job growth and decline across the UK.
